# G2-essential-mods
Gothic 2 plugins that should be played in any playthrough (modded or not)

Absolutely mandatory: [Union](https://www.sefaris.eu/union/plugins). There are many sources, but sefaris.eu is currently most convenient and reliable.

### my mods
- [my tiny zPE mods](https://github.com/the-overdriven/G2-my-zPE-mods) (runnable with zParserExtender, mods including "NB" in name are dedicated for New Balance mod) | [download all](https://github.com/the-overdriven/G2-my-zPE-mods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- [Hush Annoying Sounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/gothic2/mods/39) - makes annoying sounds quieter, so you don't have to turn down the volume for ALL sounds (including dubbing).
- [50 sounds of pain](https://www.nexusmods.com/gothic2/mods/48) - restores some unused groan sounds (male and female). Original game doesn't make use of female sounds at all.
- [Simple FPS Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/gothic2/mods/89) - increases FPS by automatically adjusting vob/sight/spawn rendering range based on your FPS rate.
- Immersive Dialog Camera
